Assume the collection of values is: 0, 1, 2, 3

We have read some of the values: 1, 2, 3
and will read 0.

| Discard | med_before | med_after |
|    1    |     1.5    |     2     |
|    2    |     1.5    |     1     |
|    3    |     1.5    |     1     |

The median after we discard any of the values are different from the true value.
